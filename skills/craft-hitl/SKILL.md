# CRAFTS HITL Gating Skill

## When to use

Invoke this skill during the **R — Render** phase of `/craft` when the current issue slice explicitly requires a human to implement or choose the critical decision-bearing logic. This is the only required human-in-the-loop gate in the CRAFTS workflow.

## Overview

The HITL (Human-In-The-Loop) gate is a sub-phase of **R — Render**. When the issue slice is labeled HITL, the agent scaffolds and tests up to the critical logic, leaves exactly one `TODO(human)` marker at the decision point, then pauses. The human fills the critical logic; the agent resumes verification and completion.

This gate exists within Render, not alongside it. After the human responds, the agent continues the Render phase (remaining tests, implementation, refactor) before proceeding to Assess.

## HITL Render Flow

### Pause

Determine whether the current issue requires a HITL gate.

**Pause when:**

- The issue slice is labeled **HITL implementation** — the agent scaffolds/tests, human owns the critical logic.
- The issue slice is labeled **HITL design/review** — implementation is agent-driven but requires human taste/content/design review.
- The critical logic involves a subjective choice (naming, UX copy, visual design, algorithmic trade-off) that the PRD or issue plan explicitly reserves for human judgment.
- The agent cannot meaningfully proceed without a decision that only the human can make.

**Do NOT pause when:**

- Routine refactoring, formatting, or test fixes.
- Clear-cut implementation where the acceptance criteria are unambiguous.
- Decisions that the agent can reasonably infer from the PRD or existing code patterns.

### Scaffold

Write all code up to but not including the critical logic. Write the surrounding tests, types, and structure.

- Leave exactly one `TODO(human)` marker at the critical decision point. Make it specific:
  - Bad: `// TODO(human): implement this`
  - Good: `// TODO(human): decide the threshold for todo_filled — should we require marker removal, or is a substantive edit sufficient?`
- Summarize the context: tell the human what has been scaffolded, what decision is needed, and what the acceptance criteria are.
- Stop processing. Do not write code past the `TODO(human)` marker.

### Resume

After the human fills the `TODO(human)` marker and signals readiness:

1. **Read the human's implementation** carefully. Do not assume it matches what you would have written.
2. **Run the tests** scoped to the changed area. Fix any test failures caused by integration mismatches.
3. **Continue Render:** complete any remaining implementation, run the full test suite.
4. **Remove the `TODO(human)` marker** from comments once the seam is filled and verified.

### Return

Return to the `/craft` full flow at the point where you left off:

- If you were mid-Render, finish Render (remaining tests, implementation, refactor).
- If Render is complete, proceed to **A — Assess**.
- `C`, `A`, `F`, `T`, and `S` remain agent-driven unless the human explicitly chooses to pause for review.

## Escalation Rules

- If a task starts as HITL but the human defers the decision back to the agent, treat it as AFK and complete autonomously.
- If a task starts as AFK but the agent discovers a subjective decision the PRD did not anticipate, pause and invoke this skill.
