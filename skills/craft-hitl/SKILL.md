# CRAFTS HITL Workflow Skill

## When to use

Invoke this skill for issue slices explicitly labeled **HITL implementation** or **HITL design/review**, or any task where the PRD reserves a critical decision for human judgment.

This is the same CRAFTS phase-gate workflow as `/craft`, but the **R — Render** phase includes mandatory human-in-the-loop gating. The agent scaffolds to the seam, pauses for human input, then resumes and completes the remaining phases.

If the task is unambiguously autonomous, use `/craft` instead.

## Overview

CRAFTS is a sequential phase-gate workflow. Do not plan or execute phases in parallel per feature or issue; finish the current phase before moving to the next one.

In HITL mode, the Render phase contains a mandatory pause. The human owns the critical decision-bearing logic; the agent owns everything before and after it.

Each phase should be delegated to its matching global subagent when the AgentSpawn tool is available. Spawn exactly one phase subagent at a time, wait for its report, then either proceed to the next phase, fix blockers, or ask the user for clarification. Do not run CRAFTS subagents in parallel.

When exact per-spawn model selection is available, the R/F builder and A evaluator must run on different but equal-capability models. For example, if `craft-builder` runs on one frontier/coding-capable model, spawn `craft-evaluator` on a different peer model rather than the same model family. If the runtime only supports tier aliases, keep both at `medium` and explicitly note that exact model diversity could not be enforced in the phase report.

| Phase | Subagent | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C — Conceptualize | `craft-planner` | Planning, TDD strategy, scope, risks, and gates |
| R — Render | `craft-builder` | Test-driven implementation and build guidance |
| A — Assess | `craft-evaluator` | Simplification, correctness, type safety, and verification review |
| F — Fix | `craft-builder` | Minimal fixes for blocking findings |
| T — Tighten | `craft-security` | Security and trust-boundary review |
| S — Sharpen | `craft-sharpener` | Durable documentation, product alignment, and retained learnings |

## Full Flow: C → R → A → F → T → S

### C — Conceptualize

Define scope, test cases, implementation plan, and risks before coding.

Use AgentSpawn with `subagent_type: "craft-planner"` for this phase when available. Pass the user request, relevant issue slice, repository constraints, and any known HITL seams. Use its report as the gate artifact before moving to Render.

- Read the relevant issue slice or user request thoroughly.
- Identify whether the work is AFK (agent can complete solo) or HITL (requires human at a critical seam).
- If multi-step, create or update a todo list before coding.
- Produce: scope boundary, acceptance criteria, file list, test strategy, and risk assessment.
- Stop here if the plan is unclear — do not proceed to Render with ambiguous requirements.

### R — Render (Test-Drive with HITL Gate)

Write failing tests first, then implement up to the critical seam, pause for human input, then complete implementation and refactor.

Use AgentSpawn with `subagent_type: "craft-builder"` for this phase when available. Pass the C phase report and ask for test-first implementation guidance. When exact model selection is available, choose a model that has an equal-capability but different-model peer available for the later `craft-evaluator` spawn. Execute the implementation sequentially in the parent context after reviewing the subagent report.

#### Red
Write the failing test from the plan. If you can't write it, return to Conceptualize.

#### Green (up to the seam)
Write the minimum implementation to pass, **stopping before the critical human-owned logic**.

- Scaffold all surrounding code: types, tests, structure, and wiring.
- Leave exactly one `TODO(human)` marker at the critical decision point. Make it specific:
  - Bad: `// TODO(human): implement this`
  - Good: `// TODO(human): decide the threshold for todo_filled — should we require marker removal, or is a substantive edit sufficient?`
- Summarize the context: tell the human what has been scaffolded, what decision is needed, and what the acceptance criteria are.
- **Stop processing.** Do not write code past the `TODO(human)` marker.

#### Human fill
Wait for the human to implement the critical logic and signal readiness.

#### Green (after the seam)
After the human responds:

1. **Read the human's implementation** carefully. Do not assume it matches what you would have written.
2. **Run the tests** scoped to the changed area. Fix any test failures caused by integration mismatches.
3. Complete any remaining implementation to make the full test suite pass.
4. **Remove the `TODO(human)` marker** once the seam is filled and verified.

#### Refactor
Clean up without breaking green. Repeat for each test case.

- Run lint, type checks, and format when all tests pass.
- If the slice requires a `TODO(human)` seam, pause for human input before continuing.

### A — Assess

Review the diff for quality, reuse, efficiency, and type correctness.

Use AgentSpawn with `subagent_type: "craft-evaluator"` for this phase when available. Pass the task goal, CRAFTS plan, changed files, verification evidence, and the model used for `craft-builder`. When exact model selection is available, use a different but equal-capability model from the builder; if only tier aliases are available, keep `medium` and record the limitation. Treat blocking findings as inputs to Fix.

- Check for duplicated logic, missed edge cases, unclear naming.
- Verify type safety if applicable.
- Verify the HITL seam integrates cleanly with the surrounding agent-scaffolded code.
- Flag anything that should be fixed before proceeding.

### F — Fix

Address blocking issues from Assess. Re-run quality checks.

Use AgentSpawn with `subagent_type: "craft-builder"` for this phase when available. Pass only the blocking findings and relevant context so fixes remain minimal and scoped.

- High and medium severity first.
- Disagree with a finding? Document why instead of blindly fixing.

### T — Tighten

Run the security-hardening review for the diff and fix findings.

Use AgentSpawn with `subagent_type: "craft-security"` for this phase when available. Pass the task goal, changed files, verification output, and any trust boundaries identified during Conceptualize or Render.

- Scan for injection risks, unsafe defaults, exposed secrets.
- Verify boundary enforcement where applicable.
- Pay special attention to the HITL seam: does the human-owned logic introduce any trust boundary issues?

### S — Sharpen

Capture durable lessons, gotchas, process updates, and any documentation changes so repo docs stay evergreen and aligned to code.

Use AgentSpawn with `subagent_type: "craft-sharpener"` for this phase when available. Pass the final diff summary, verification results, issue status, and any conventions or gotchas discovered during the task.

- Document the HITL seam and the rationale for the human-owned decision.
- Update the relevant domain docs (README, ADR, CLAUDE.md, PRD, ISSUES) with patterns established, gotchas discovered, conventions set during this task.
- Commit and push if applicable.

## Lite Flow: R → S

For simple HITL tasks (config changes, single-file fixes with one obvious seam):

1. **R — Render:** scaffold to the seam, pause for human input, complete, verify.
2. **S — Sharpen:** capture any doc updates and commit.

Start lite, then escalate to full if the task grows or the seam is more complex than expected.

## Escalation Rules

- Start lite. If the task grows beyond a single file or the HITL seam has ripple effects, escalate to full.
- Never skip Assess and Tighten on code that crosses a trust boundary or handles user input.
- If a task starts as HITL but the human defers the decision back to the agent, switch to `/craft` and complete autonomously.
- If Render reaches a `TODO(human)` seam, pause for human input before continuing.
